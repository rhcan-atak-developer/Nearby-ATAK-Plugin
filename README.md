# Nearby ATAK Plugin

This plugin was developed during the first TAKathon that was held in Washington DC in July 2023. The plugin allows an ATAK user to generate geolocalized markers for nearby points of interest and traffic events. The plugin uses the Bing Maps API to fetch the information from their online databases (internet connection is required).
